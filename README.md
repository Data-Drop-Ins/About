# Ethos
Our ethos is to explore and to experiment. These meetings aim to be inclusive, open to academic and professional services staff and postgraduate researchers. Sessions are facilitated rather than didactic. Our emphasis is on active listening and peer-learning.

We encourage participants to share something about their research each session, subject to restrictions that may be ethical or relate to intellectual property. This can include, but is not limited to, examples of data, teaching materials, presentations or code itself. We aim for an open approach, but participants are expected to acknowledge their peers' intellectual property and any licensing requirements for re-using information.

We believe in a respectful, non-judgemental environment, where participants adopt an open mind. Each research project is unique to the person. Each person is a unique combination of experience and education. Although certain methods and tools may be more effective to manage certain types of data, and some individuals may be more proficient in certain methods, this does not affect the value of a research project or a person.  

# Aims
We will consider how the methods and tools of data science can be used to capture, structure, clean and analyse data using programming languages such as Python. We will also consider many open source tools and resources to support you in managing and using your data effectively, such as Open Refine.
